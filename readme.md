# MathiasPicker.com 👨🏽‍💻

All code is written independently and fairly represents my JavaScipt coding (as of 19. April 2020) and
how i like to experiment/create things when programming front-end stuff.
Actually i'd say this code mostly represents my experimentation and how i just let my mind
have fun without caring to much about readabiliy.

If you really want to see the best representation of my coding skills, then check
out my NPM project 'makemy': https://github.com/make-my/makemyexperiment/create
 
Usually i like to split up my code into different modules, but i've kept
everything in one place so that people who are interested in examining my code
can do so.
